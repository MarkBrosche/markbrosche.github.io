description: The Money Tree was a social engineering project for High Fidelity aimed at fostering a supportive and welcoming community to welcome new and returning users.  The idea was that the tree, placed in the center of "The Spot" domain would randomly select a nearby user to nominate another nearby user for a small monetary gift from High Fidelity at randomized intervals.  The tree required a minimum number of people present to work and I built it in a way to discourage bad behavior.
