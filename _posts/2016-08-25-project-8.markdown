description: I led and organized the training for and development of the first mixed reality technology demonstration for the Laboratory.  With a team of 15 engineers and artists behind me, I proved in a very big way that high quality training could be achieved with immersive simulators that cost a fraction of full scale replicated simulators currently in use.
