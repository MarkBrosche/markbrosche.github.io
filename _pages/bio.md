I am a XR developer and enthusiast! I live and breathe immersive technology and all that it enables.

I started my professional career as a mechanical engineer out of Florida State University and worked with the Naval Nuclear Laboratory first as prototype engineer supporting power plant operations and maintenance.  In 2013 I was invited to join the training simulators group, and more directly support the training mission at my site.  From that group I first came into contact with virtual reality (as an adult) and was the catalyst that set me off on an entirely different and exciting career path.

Since then, I have nearly completed my graduate degree in Computational Simulation Engineering at Old Dominion University (graduating Fall 2019!), laid the foundations for VR training for nuclear reactor operations by creating 2 proof of concept demonstrations merging physical tactile equipment and VR environments (like [the Void](https://www.thevoid.com)) and 1 deployed trainer between 2016 and 2018.

Most recently I was part of High Fidelity, the Open Source Social VR platform founded by the creator of Second Life, Philip Rosedale.  There I was on the experiences team and created content for large events, blue-prints for users to rework, and more.
