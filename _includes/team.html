                            I live and breathe immersive technology and all that it enables.<br>
                            I started my professional career as a mechanical engineer but when I first tried 
                            the Oculus Rift DK2 in 2014 I knew then what I had to do.
                            Since then, I have nearly completed my graduate degree in Computational Simulation 
                            Engineering at Old Dominion University (graduating Fall 2019!), laid the foundations 
                            for VR training for nuclear reactor operations by creating 2 proof of concept 
                            demonstrations merging physical tactile equipment and VR environments (like [the Void](https://www.thevoid.com))
                            and 1 deployed trainer between 2016 and 2018.
                            Most recently I was part of High Fidelity, the Open Source Social VR platform 
                            founded by the creator of Second Life, Philip Rosedale.  There I was on the experiences 
                            team and created content for large events, blue-prints for users to rework, and more.
